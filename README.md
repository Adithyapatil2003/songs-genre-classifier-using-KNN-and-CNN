# Songs-genre-classifier-using-KNN-and-CNN

 ∗ Developed a machine learning model to classify songs into genres using the GT-ZAN dataset.
 #
 ∗ Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify songs into various
 genres.
 #
 ∗ Preprocessed audio data, including feature extraction and normalization, to ensure high-quality inputs for the
 models.
 #
 ∗ Evaluated model performance using Accuracy metric
